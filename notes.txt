There are several sections the compiler
puts stuff into:

codeseg = code
constseg = constant data
bssseg = uninitialized variables
dataseg = initialized variables

You have to change the destination section
for each of those segments on the zcc line.

zsdcc can only do codeseg and constseg so
the recommended thing to do is declare anything
destined for bss or data sections in asm where
they can be placed properly.

example of c declarations:

extern int a;   // bss
extern int b = 10;   // data

Then in a separate asm file define the variables
placed in a specific section:

SECTION bss_name
PUBLIC _a
_a : defs 2

SECTION data_name
PUBLIC _b
_b : defw 10

That should be "extern int b;".
The C declarations are not creating space -
they only tell the compiler the variables
exist and are defined elsewhere.
