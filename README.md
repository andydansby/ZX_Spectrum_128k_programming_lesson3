Lesson 3 in programming a 128K Spectrum with Z88dk SCCZ80

This is Part 3 of programming a 128K Spectrum with Z88dk using the SCCZ80 compiler.

Step by step programming for a 128K Spectrum. In this lesson we are expanding to place assembly code in different sections allowing us to pinpoint in which part of memory an assembly code program may run.
